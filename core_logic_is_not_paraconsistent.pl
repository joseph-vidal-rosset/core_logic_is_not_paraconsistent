%
% --------------------------------------------------------------------
% WHAT PROLOG ADDS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A CERTIFICATION
% --------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%   The deductive step of the proof -- that Claim 1, together with
%   the rules of fragment F, entails a contradiction -- is CERTIFIED
%   in three independent proof assistants: Coq, Lean, and Athena. In
%   each, a proof object (or its evaluation) is checked against a
%   small trusted kernel, and the extra-logical commitments are
%   auditable and closed (in Coq, "Print Assumptions" returns exactly
%   the two axioms Claim1_Tennant and min_antisequent_rule_to_core).
%
%   Prolog is NOT a theorem verifier, and nothing below is a fourth
%   certification. Prolog is a logic-programming language with a fixed
%   SLD-resolution strategy; here it is programmed, and cast, in the
%   role of a proof checker. Its trust base is not a kernel but this
%   entire hand-written program, plus our reading of what its
%   execution means. What follows is therefore OPERATIONAL
%   CORROBORATION, not certification -- valuable as an executable
%   model, but epistemically distinct in kind from the three
%   assistants.
%
%   With that caveat, the program does two things the assistants, by
%   their open-world nature, do not:
%
%   1. IT SEARCHES FOR THE ANTISEQUENTS.  Claims 1 and 2 assert that
%      ~A, A |/- B  and  ~A, A |/- ~B  are basic antisequents of Core
%      Logic, i.e. that no derivation of these sequents exists in F.
%      Exhausting an iterative-deepening search over the finite
%      fragment, Prolog FAILS TO FIND any derivation (commands
%      ?- theorem.  and  ?- corollary.).  Under the closed-world
%      assumption, a faithful encoding, and a depth bound adequate for
%      these shallow sequents, that failure CORROBORATES the
%      underivability -- it does not prove it: "no derivation of depth
%      =< 6 was found" becomes "no derivation exists" only by an
%      argument made outside Prolog.  The proof assistants, having no
%      closed-world semantics, cannot even attempt this; they must
%      posit the antisequent as a hypothesis (axiom).
%
%   2. IT CONSTRUCTS the explicit derivation of
%        ~A, (A=>B)=>B |- B          (via DNS.2)
%      and of
%        ~A, (A=>~B)=>~B |- ~B       (Corollary, via DNS.2 with ~B),
%      exhibiting -- with a bussproofs LaTeX rendering -- the other
%      branch of the contradiction square as a concrete proof tree.
%
%   Hence the division of labour: the three assistants CERTIFY the
%   deductive inference; this Prolog program CORROBORATES, by search
%   and by construction, the two branches it feeds on. Corroboration
%   and certification are complementary, not interchangeable.
%
% --------------------------------------------------------------------
% STRICT CORE vs PERMISSIVE MODE
% --------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%   This file provides two modes of derivability check:
%
%   - PERMISSIVE (the default `holds/1`):  axioms admit the form
%     Gamma:A with A in Gamma, regardless of the rest of Gamma.
%     This silently incorporates Weakening on the left into the
%     axioms.  Faster proof search, but not strictly Tennant.
%
%   - STRICT Tennant (`holds_strict/1`):  axioms are strictly
%     [C]:C  (Gamma is the singleton {C}).  The rule L-> splits
%     the context explicitly between its two premisses (Delta1 in
%     the left, Delta2 in the right).  The rule R-> covers both
%     effective and vacuous discharge (Tennant's diamond on the
%     discharge stroke).  This is faithful to Core Logic
%     (Tennant 2017, p. 21).
%
%   Use  ?- core_strict.  to test the paper's critical sequents in
%   strict Core mode.  Use  ?- main.  for the full permissive run.
%
%   NOTE ON THE COMPROMISE.  The default mode (`main.`) uses
%   permissive axioms that admit Weakening on the left at the
%   leaves of derivations.  This is purely a matter of efficiency:
%   strict Core proof search (with explicit context splitting via
%   `split_context/3`) is exponential in context size, and an
%   iterative-deepening engine working without Weakening becomes
%   impractical even on small examples.  For the specific sequents
%   of the paper, both modes agree: the permissive run verifies
%   the explicit derivations of DNS.1, DNS.2, the Theorem and the
%   Corollary; the strict run verifies, on a smaller but
%   independent set of sequents, that the result holds also under
%   a Tennant-faithful axiom set.

% AXIOMS
% ================================================================

% Fragment F has a single initial-sequent (axiom) schema, in the
% membership (extensional) form used throughout: a sequent Gamma |- A is
% initial when the formula A belongs to the pool Gamma. This mirrors the
% axiom of the three certifications -- Coq's
% [In A G -> derivable f G (Some A)], Lean's
% [A in G -> Derivable f G (some A)], Athena's [mem A G] -- read here
% under the "contexts as available assumptions" convention. The two
% guards keep proof search faithful and terminating: bot is the object
% marker for the empty succedent, never an axiom; and an implication
% A=>B is not accepted as an axiom by membership but derived (via R->
% over L->), matching the paper's remark that the identity sequent on an
% implication is derived, not initial (axioms being atomic).
%
% NOTE. A former second clause,
%     ax(Gamma:B) :- iso_member(_:B, Gamma), B \= bot.
% has been removed. It fired only when the context list literally held a
% sequent-shaped term (_ : B) -- which the calculus never constructs,
% since the rules insert formulas, not sequents. It was therefore dead
% on every well-formed sequent and had no counterpart in Table 1 or in
% the Coq / Lean / Athena rule sets. Removing it leaves every verdict
% unchanged and makes the axiom set exactly the membership schema below.
