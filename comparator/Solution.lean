   Proof in Lean 4 that Core Logic is not Paraconsistent
   ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   This Lean 4 file certifies the argument according to which
   Tennant's two foundational claims about Core logic ℂ — that ℂ is
   paraconsistent (Claim 1), and that ℂ merely overlaps minimal logic
   𝐌 rather than including it (Claim 2) — cannot be sustained without
   contradiction. The proof is done inside a small fragment ℱ of ℂ,
   using only rules that Tennant himself accepts.

   This file is a port of the Coq script
   `core_logic_is_not_paraconsistent.v`. It uses only core Lean 4
   (no Mathlib dependency).

   It differs from the Coq script in one presentational respect:
   where the Coq script posits Tennant's two commitments as global
   `Axiom`s (audited by `Print Assumptions`), this file internalises
   them as named hypotheses of the final theorem — an equivalent
   formulation, by the deduction theorem, with an empty axiom
   budget: `#print axioms claim1_false` reports no non-logical
   axiom. In this form the proof is also certified by the Lean
   Comparator (comparator.live.lean-lang.org) against a trusted
   challenge stating the theorem.

/- The language of ℱ is the usual propositional language built from
   atomic variables, negation, and implication. Propositional
   variables are indexed by natural numbers via the constructor
   `Var : Nat → Formula`, providing a countably infinite supply of
   distinct atoms. -/

/- ── Local note ──
   The three constructors are distinct by construction. In Lean 4,
   what Coq does with `discriminate` and `injection` is subsumed by
   `cases`, `injection`, and the `injection`/`noConfusion` machinery
   triggered by pattern matching. -/

/- Fragment ℱ contains five rules: Ax., L¬, R→, L→, and the
   Core-specific rule R→ℂ. The first four rules are exactly those of
   minimal logic 𝐌 in fragment ℱ. The fifth, R→ℂ, derives an
   implication from an inconsistent context and is the single rule
   that distinguishes ℂ from 𝐌 in ℱ.

   To represent both readings of ℱ in a single inductive predicate,
   we introduce a fragment indicator `f : FragmentF` taking two
   values, `minimal_F` and `core_logic`. The first five rules
   quantify universally over `f` and therefore exist in both
   readings; the sixth, `R_arrow_core`, fixes `f = core_logic` in
   its signature and is restricted by typing to the Core reading.

   Sequents are encoded with contexts as `List Formula`. An explicit
   `Exchange` constructor is added to permit swapping two adjacent
   formulas in a doubleton context. Right-hand sides are encoded as
   `Option Formula`: `some A` represents a single succedent formula,
   `none` the empty succedent (used in inconsistency sequents Γ ⊢).

   An antisequent Γ ⊬ C is written directly as the type

                Derivable f Γ C → False

   No separate "unprovable" predicate is introduced. -/

/- ── Local note ──
   The signature of `R_arrow_core` is the key typing constraint of
   this file: by fixing `core_logic` in both premiss and conclusion,
   the constructor refuses to exist for `f = minimal_F`. In any
   induction at `f = minimal_F`, the case `R_arrow_core` is therefore
   eliminated by `cases` on the frozen equation `minimal_F = f`. -/

/- Since ℱ shares its first four rules between 𝐌 and ℂ, every
   derivation built in `minimal_F` can be replayed verbatim in
   `core_logic`. The lemma below makes this inclusion mechanically
   explicit. It is the formal expression of ℱ as a shared fragment:
   nothing is imported from outside ℱ when one moves from the minimal
   reading to the Core reading. -/

/- ── Local note ──
   `generalize hf : minimal_F = f at h` freezes `minimal_F` as a
   fresh variable `f` together with the equation
   `hf : minimal_F = f`. Without this freezing, the case
   `R_arrow_core` would no longer be discharged. That sixth case is
   closed by `cases hf`, which exploits the impossibility of
   `minimal_F = core_logic` (two distinct constructors of
   `FragmentF`). -/

/- The sequent ¬A, A ⊢ is the left subtree of the final contradiction
   (paper §2.5). It expresses the inconsistency of the context
   {¬A, A} and is derivable by a single application of L¬ preceded by
   an Exchange to bring ¬A into head position. -/

   The Exchange step is needed because `L_neg` requires ¬A at the
   head of the context, while the convention adopted in the rest of
   the file places ¬A in second position. The `by simp` discharges
   the membership obligation `Var a ∈ [Var a, Neg (Var a)]`. -/

/- Following Slaney [Slaney 1994], we call DNS (Double Negation
   à la Slaney) two rules central to the argument:

         A, ∆ ⊢ B                          A, ∆ ⊢
     ─────────────────── DNS.1     ─────────────────── DNS.2
     (A → B) → B, ∆ ⊢ B            (A → B) → B, ∆ ⊢ B

   DNS.1 is derivable in 𝐌 using R→ and L→. DNS.2 is derivable in
   ℂ using R→ℂ and L→: it requires the Core-specific rule because
   its premiss has an empty succedent. Both derivations live entirely
   inside ℱ (see paper, Table 2). We instantiate both rules at the
   specific contexts that appear in the final argument, namely
   A = Var a, ∆ = [Neg (Var a)], B = Var b. -/

/- DNS.1 is invertible: from the derivability of its conclusion, the
   derivability of its premiss follows. This is the formal counterpart
   of the syntactic and semantic proofs given in the paper (§2.3).
   The semantic proof, in particular, is independent of any classical
   commitment and applies under the minimal reading of ⊥ as a
   nonlogical constant.

   The mechanisation proceeds in two steps. First, a sub-lemma
   inverts R→ over the singleton context [¬A]. Then the main theorem
   inverts DNS.1 over the doubleton context, generalised over both
   orderings to absorb the `Exchange` constructor. -/

/- The derivation of contradiction needs two hypotheses that the
   theorem makes explicit and traceable in its own signature. The
   first encodes Tennant's Claim 1
   (Core Logic, p. 156): the antisequent ¬A, A ⊬ B is posited as
   holding in ℂ. The second encodes the structural property of ℱ as
   a fragment shared by 𝐌 and ℂ: any antisequent rule established by
   induction on the rules of ℱ shared by 𝐌 and ℂ belongs to both
   readings. To deny this hypothesis would amount to claiming that
   the shared rules of ℱ produce consequences in 𝐌 that they do not
   produce in ℂ — which would contradict the very notion of a shared
   fragment. -/

/- ── Comparator note ──
   In the original file these two hypotheses were declared as global
   `axiom`s. The Lean Comparator rejects any axiom beyond Lean's
   three built-ins (`propext`, `Quot.sound`, `Classical.choice`), so
   they are internalised here as named hypotheses of the theorem.
   The proof body is unchanged; the certified statement is now a
   pure conditional resting on no non-logical axiom whatsoever. -/

/-  (1) DNS.1-anti, established in `minimal_F` (`DNS1_anti_instantiated`),
        is lifted to `core_logic` by the rule-transfer axiom
        (`min_antisequent_rule_to_core`). This yields
        a Core-level antisequent rule
                  ¬A, A ⊬ B  ⇒  ¬A, (A → B) → B ⊬ B.
    (2) The lifted rule is applied to Tennant's Claim 1, yielding
        the fatal antisequent ¬A, (A → B) → B ⊬ B in ℂ.
    (3) DNS.2 (`DNS2_instantiated`), derivable in ℂ from the absurdity
        ¬A, A ⊢ via R→ℂ, yields ¬A, (A → B) → B ⊢ B in ℂ.
    (4) (2) and (3) directly contradict each other, producing
        False.
    Therefore Claim 1 cannot be maintained in ℂ without
    contradiction: if ℂ is consistent, it cannot be paraconsistent. ∎ -/

                     — list the axioms a theorem ultimately depends
                       on.

   Tactics on inductive types and equality
     • `induction`, `cases`, `injection`, `rcases`, `subst`
                     — structural induction, case analysis,
                       extraction of subterm equality.

   Generalisation
     • `generalize`  — counterpart of Coq's `remember`; freezes a
                       term as a fresh variable plus an equation.
